📊 Excited to Share My New Power BI Dashboard! | Mobile Sales Data Analysis
I’m happy to share a Mobile Sales Data Dashboard that I recently created using Microsoft Power BI.
This dashboard provides a complete analytical view of mobile sales performance across cities, months, payment methods, brands, and customer ratings.
Some key insights visualized in the dashboard:
🔹 Total Sales & Transactions Overview
🔹 Sales by City (Map Visualization)
🔹 Total Quantity by Month & Day
🔹 Payment Method Analysis
🔹 Customer Ratings Breakdown
🔹 Brand-wise Sales Comparison
This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
✔ Data Cleaning & Modeling
✔ Creating slicers and dynamic filters
✔ Using DAX for calculated columns and measures
✔ Building interactive visual reports
✔ Designing dashboards for clear business insights
A special thanks to Satish Dhawale Dhawale Sir, Dhawale founder of SkillCourse ,whose practical and beginner-friendly teaching style made learning Power BI much easier. Your guidance helped me build this dashboard with confidence.
